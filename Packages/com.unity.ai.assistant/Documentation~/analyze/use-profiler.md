# Analyze a Unity Profiler capture

Use Assistant to analyze specific profiling samples directly from the Profiler window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature requires Unity 6.4 or later.

Use this workflow when you're already inspecting profiling data and want explanations or optimization guidance for a specific frame, sample, or timeline entry.

Before you start, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- A saved or active profiling session is available in the Profiler.
- Assistant is enabled in the Unity Editor.

To ask Assistant about profiler data, follow these steps:

1. Select **Window** > **Analysis** > **Profiler** to open the **Profiler** window.
1. Load a saved profiling session or record a new one.
1. Change to a supported view, such as **Timeline**.
1. Select a profiler sample or frame.
1. Select **Ask Assistant**.

   A prompt appears with a suggested question based on the selected sample. You can edit this prompt before submitting it. The selected profiling data is automatically attached.
