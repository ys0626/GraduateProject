# AI Assistant Integration Onboarding

Welcome! This guide will help your team integrate AI capabilities into your Unity package using the AI Assistant framework.

## Getting Started

### API Sample

A good place to start is checking out our [API Sample](SAMPLE.md).

To try this example, you will have to make sure your Player Settings define the `ASSISTANT_INTERNAL` symbol.
The sample will then be available through the `AI Assistant > Internals > API Sample` menu in the Editor.

You can check out our included `Test Project` to try this out.

### Repository & Key Resources

- [Main Repository (this one)](../../../../../../) 
- [AI Assistant API](../../../../../com.unity.ai.assistant/Editor/Assistant/Api)
- [Integrations Folder](../../../../../com.unity.ai.assistant/Editor/Assistant/Integrations)
- [API Sample](../../../../../com.unity.ai.assistant/Editor/Assistant/Integrations/Sample)
- [Test Project](../../../../../../Projects/TestProject)

## Creating Your Integration

### 1. Set Up Your Integration Assembly

1. Copy the [Sample Integration](../../../../../com.unity.ai.assistant/Editor/Assistant/Integrations/Sample) from the Integrations folder as a starting point
2. Rename the folder and files to match your package (e.g., Profiler, 2D)
3. Configure your `.asmdef` file with appropriate name and references

## Building Your Agent

### 1. Create Your Custom Agent

Define an agent tailored to your domain using the fluent API:

```csharp
static IAgent CreateMyCustomAgent()
{
    var agent = new LlmAgent()
        .WithId("unity_profiler")
        .WithName("Profiling Agent")
        .WithDescription("Specialized agent for analyzing Unity performance and profiling data, such as memory usage, expensive calls, etc.")
        .WithSystemPrompt(@"
    You are a Unity performance profiling expert. Your role is to:
    1. Analyze performance data and identify bottlenecks
    2. Provide actionable optimization recommendations
    3. Explain performance metrics in clear, developer-friendly terms
    4. Focus on Unity-specific performance considerations
    5. Do not ask the user for more information.

    Always base your analysis on the provided profiling data and use the available tools to gather additional information when needed.
    In your final answer, when you mention a specific profiler data frame, always mention it as a url with the following format:
    [Frame 17](profiler://frame/17) where 17 here is the frame index.
")
        .WithToolsFrom<MyProfilingTools>()
        .WithToolsFrom<AdditionalTools>();
    
    return agent;
}
```

**Key Components:**

- **Id:** Unique identifier for your agent (no spaces, only alphanumeric characters and underscores)
- **Name:** User-facing name displayed in the UI
- **Description:** Explains the agent's purpose and capabilities. This is used by the orchestration system to pick the best agent for a user request so it should be a good balance of generic and precise.
- **SystemPrompt:** Defines the agent's behavior, expertise, and constraints. This is where you can give instructions specific to your domain so that the agent can better perform its task.
- **Tools:** Custom functions your agent can call to interact with your package/domain.

### 2. Define Your Tools

Tools are static C# methods that your agent can call to interact with your package or perform specific tasks. Use the `[AgentTool]` attribute to expose methods to your agent. Both synchronous and asynchronous methods are supported.

```csharp
[AgentTool(
    "Get current project settings and configuration.",
    "Unity.Sample.GetProjectSettings",
    assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask)]
public static string GetProjectSettings()
{
    // Here make a call to your API
    return "Project configuration data";
}
```

> **Note:** Tools execution will happen on the main thread, but complex/long operations should be implemented as `async` methods to avoid blocking the Editor.

**Tool Parameters:**

- **description:** Clear explanation of what the tool does - helps the agent decide when to use it. Description should avoid mentioning specific parameters, other tools, other agents, implementation details or be goal oriented. Just describe what the tool does.
- **id:** Unique identifier for the tool. This ID should be made of at least 3 dot-separated parts, the first one being "Unity" and the second the domain of the tool, like "Unity.GameObject.Create"
- **toolCallEnvironment:** Specifies when the tool is available:
  - `Runtime`: Available in Unity Runtime (no Editor present)
  - `PlayMode`: Available in Unity's Play Mode
  - `EditMode`: Available in Unity's Edit Mode
  - Can be combined: `ToolCallEnvironment.EditMode | ToolCallEnvironment.PlayMode`
- **assistantMode:** Specifies which assistant modes can use this tool:
  - `AssistantMode.Agent`: For any tool, including tools that modify objects or data, or that only do read-only operations.
  - `AssistantMode.Ask`: For tools that only perform read-only operations
  - Can be combined: `AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask`
  - A read-only tool is expected to be available in both modes, except if there is a specific variant of this tool for the Agent mode: `AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask`

**Method Requirements:**

> **Important:** You should read our [tool guidelines](TOOL_GUIDELINES.md) to better implement your tools.

- Must be a static method with the `[AgentTool]` attribute
- Each parameter must have a `[Parameter]` attribute describing what the parameter does, its default values, and example for complex parameters.
- First parameter can optionally be `ToolExecutionContext` to receive execution context (not sent to LLM). In this case, your tool should most likely be async. Use this context when:
  - Your tool create / delete / modify objects, data or files: you will need to call the Permissions checks from the context, and record file operation through the Undo context.
  - You need to display a custom UX to get user input during the tool execution
- **Return type:** any type that can be serialized to JSON

**Permissions check:**

You can find more information about permissions checks in [tool guidelines](TOOL_GUIDELINES.md) and see a concrete example in our [API Sample](SAMPLE.md).
Tools are automatically inspected to check if they do require specific permission checks or not. In such a case, an error will be logged to the console and you must implement the appropriate check(s).
Here is a basic example of implementing a permission check in a tool:

```csharp
[AgentTool(
    "Writes to a file.",
    "Unity.ApiSample.WriteFile",
    assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent)]
public static async Task WriteFile(ToolExecutionContext context, string path, string text)
{
    await context.Permissions.CheckFileSystemAccess(
        IToolPermissions.ItemOperation.Create, path);
    
    await File.WriteAllTextAsync(path, text);
}
```

> **Note:** Any tool that check permission(s) **MUST** be async and have a `ToolExecutionContext` parameter.

## Using the API

### 3. One-Shot Headless Execution

Run your agent programmatically without UI and async, in a one-shot fashion. This will not use the orchestration system nor the other agents, only your custom agent:

```csharp
static async Task<string> RunAgentHeadless()
{
    var agent = CreateMyCustomAgent();
    var prompt = "How do I optimize my workflow?";
    return await agent.RunHeadless(prompt);
}
```

**Use Cases:** Automation, testing, background processing

### 4. UI Integration

Launch your agent with the Assistant UI. This will run the normal Assistant, including the full orchestration system and all other existing agents. This also means the user will be able to resume the discussion, asking follow-up questions or make requests that might require other agents.

> **Note:** If you need the agent to perform a specific task within the orchestration, use the skill system.
>
> **Important:** Skills registered via the API (using `SkillsRegistry.AddSkills`) are subject to the user opt-in filter and will be denied by default. Built-in skills that ship as part of a package must add `.WithTag(SkillRegistryTags.BuiltIn)` to their `SkillDefinition` to bypass this filter and remain always active. Without it, the skill silently disappears from the assistant with no way for the user to re-enable it through the Preferences UI.

Then run the Assistant with UI:

```csharp
static async Task RunAgentWithUI()
{
    var prompt = "How do I optimize my workflow?";
    await AssistantApi.Run(prompt);
}
```

**Use Cases:** Interactive workflows, user-facing features, debugging assistance

### 5. Embedded UI with PromptThenRun

Integrate the Assistant UI directly into your package. This shows a prompt popup near your UI element, then displays the Assistant chat when the user submits:

![Prompt Popup](Images/PromptPopup.png)

```csharp
// Call from your package UI
await AssistantApi.PromptThenRun(
    anchorElement: myVisualElement  // Your UI element to anchor the prompt near
);
```

The popup appears above or below the specified VisualElement, allowing users to enter a prompt directly within your package's UI. Once submitted, the full Assistant interface takes over to process the request.

**Use Cases:** Contextual AI assistance within your editor windows, quick access to agent capabilities without leaving your workflow

### 6. Attaching Custom Data

Attach custom data (aka "context") that will be given to the Assistant as additional info with the user prompt.

You must first create a context object:

```csharp
var attachedContext = new AssistantApi.AttachedContext();
```

Then you can attach one or multiple Unity.Object like so:

```csharp
attachedContext.Add(myGameObject);
attachedContext.Add(someTextureAsset);
attachedContext.Add(someSceneComponent);
```

Or even define custom attachments:

```csharp
var attachment = new VirtualAttachment("Some payload data", "Custom Type Name", "A name", someMetadataObject);
attachedContext.Add(attachment);
```

Finally, you can specify this context data when using any of the available run APIs (headless, UI or with Embedded UI):

```csharp
output = await agent.RunHeadless(prompt, attachedContext: attachedContext);
await AssistantApi.Run(prompt, attachedContext: attachedContext);
await AssistantApi.PromptThenRun(prompt, attachedContext: attachedContext);
```

**Use Cases:** Adding extra info to the request, specifying request context

## Customizing the UI

### 1. Custom Function Call Renderers

Customize how your tool calls appear in the Assistant chat view by creating custom renderers. By default, tool calls display with a title and parameters:

![Function Call](Images/FunctionCall.png)

When expanded, they show the content returned by the tool:

![Function Call Expanded](Images/FunctionCallExpanded.png)

**What You Can Customize:**

- **Title:** Change how the tool invocation is labeled
- **Parameters:** Customize how input parameters are displayed
- **Content:** Render the tool's output with any VisualElement you want

**Basic Example:**

```csharp
[FunctionCallRenderer(typeof(ProjectTools), nameof(ProjectTools.GetSettings))]
class GetProjectSettingsFunctionCallRenderer : DefaultFunctionCallRenderer
{
    // Customize the title
    public override string Title => "Getting Project Settings";

    // Customize the parameter display
    public override string TitleDetails => "";

    // Customize the display when the tool is called
    public override void OnCallRequest(AssistantFunctionCall functionCall)
    {
        // Do any update that might require the tool call parameters
    }
    
    // Customize the display when the tool call successfully completed
    public override void OnCallSuccess(string functionId, Guid callId, IFunctionCaller.CallResult result)
    {
        // Custom content rendering
        var container = new VisualElement();
        container.AddToClassList("project-settings-result");
        
        var label = new Label("Project Configuration:");
        label.AddToClassList("settings-header");
        container.Add(label);
        
        var contentLabel = new Label(result.Result);
        contentLabel.AddToClassList("settings-content");
        container.Add(contentLabel);
        
        Add(container);
    }
    
    // Customize the display when the tool call failed
    public override void OnCallError(string functionId, Guid callId, string error)
    {
        var errorLabel = new Label($"Failed to retrieve settings: {error}");
        errorLabel.AddToClassList("error-message");
        Add(errorLabel);
    }
}
```

Custom renderers allow you to:

- Provide clearer, user-friendly labels for tool invocations
- Format complex data structures in a readable way
- Add custom styling, icons, or visual elements
- Create interactive displays (buttons, links, formatted tables, etc.). Note that these interactive elements will not impact the tool call itself. There is another mechanism for that.
- Give users better context about what the agent is doing

You have full control over the rendering using Unity's UI Toolkit - any VisualElement can be used to display your tool's results.

### 2. Custom Interactions

Create interactive UI elements that appear in the chat during a tool call, to wait for a user or input.

First define the interaction class, which specifies the interaction return type and the UX:

```csharp
class PickSessionInteraction : BaseInteraction<SessionProvider.ProfilerSessionInfo>
{
    public PickSessionInteraction(List<SessionProvider.ProfilerSessionInfo> sessions)
    {
        // Build your custom UI
        foreach (var session in sessions)
        {
            var button = new Button(() => CompleteInteraction(session))
            {
                text = "Select"
            };
            Add(button);
        }
    }
}
```

Then use the interaction from within a tool. Your tool must be async and passed the ToolExecutionContext parameter:

```csharp
[AgentTool("Let the user pick a profiling session", id: "Unity.Profiler.PickSession", assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask)]
public static async Task<string> PickSession(ToolExecutionContext context)
{
    var profilingSessions = await SessionProvider.GetProfilingSessions(context);
    
    // Create the interaction element and wait for the user interaction            
    var pickSessionInteraction = new PickSessionInteraction(profilingSessions);
    var selectedSession = await context.Interactions.WaitForUser(pickSessionInteraction);
    
    return selectedSession.Path;
}
```

**Example:** PickSessionInteraction.cs

Custom interactions enable:

- Rich selection interfaces (file pickers, option lists, etc.)
- Interactive workflows where the agent needs user input mid-conversation
- Domain-specific UI components tailored to your package

### 3. Custom Link Handlers

Define the behavior when the user clicks on specific links in the Assistant answer.

The following would handle any link starting with "profiler://":

```csharp
[LinkHandler("profiler")]
public class SampleLinkHandler : ILinkHandler
{
    public void Handle(ILinkHandler.Context context, string prefix, string url)
    {
        Debug.Log($"[SAMPLE] Clicked link: '{url}' with prefix '{prefix}'");
    }
}
```

Custom link handlers enable:

- Performing custom action when a link is clicked
- Providing extra data for the action as part of the url parameters

## Vision Capabilities

The AI Assistant is using a multi-modal model with vision capabilities, meaning that it can take images as input.
This section describes the current vision features that our C# API enables.

> **Note**: Analyzing image data can be expensive and slow. The vision capabilities should thus be used with care. In addition, **the image content might be resized** to reduce token usage.

### 1. Attaching Image Data

In some cases you might need to attach image data to a request:

```csharp
var attachedContext = new AssistantApi.AttachedContext();
attachedContext.AddImageContent(someTexture, "SomeDisplayName");
```

> **Note**: when you attach a Texture asset (such as a Texture2D) as an Object attachment, the core agent can retrieve its content via tools as needed. Consider directly attaching image data only if you are sure that analyzing the image content is necessary.

### 2. Returning Image Data from a Tool

If a tool needs to return image data that the AI Assistant should analyze to perfom its tasks, then the tool must return a single object of type `ImageOutput`.

You **must** use the available constructors to build the `ImageOutput` object:

```csharp
[AgentTool("Captures a multi-angle view of the scene for verification", "Unity.SceneView.CaptureMultiAngleSceneView", assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask)]
internal static ImageOutput CaptureMultiAngleSceneView(ToolExecutionContext context, int[] focusObjectIds = null)
{
    // Your logic that produces image data (e.g., render scene from multiple angles)
    var texture = GetRenderedSceneTexture();
    var result = new ImageOutput(texture, "Multi-angle scene capture", "SceneCapture");
    return result;
}
```

Returning image content is useful when:
- Rendering a preview for the AI Assistant to check visually
- Analyzing the visual content of something

## Advanced features

### 1. Persistent Storage

The `ToolExecutionContext` provides a way to store persistent data for the current conversation.
Data will be persisted after domain reload but also after Unity restart.
Any data serializable to JSON can be persisted.
> **Important**: This data is only available on the user's local machine and can be cleared by the user. Your code must therefore account for cases where the data may be unavailable and handle this appropriately.

You can store persistent data like so:

```csharp
[AgentTool("Some tool", "Unity.ApiSample.SomeTool", assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask)]
public static void SomeTool(ToolExecutionContext context)
{
	// Store persistent data, it will be immediately saved
	MyCustomType data = ...;
	context.Conversation.PersistentStorage.SetState("someKey", data);
}
```

> **Note**: You must provide a unique key for your data so that it doesn't conflict with the data from other tools.

and retrieve it like so:

```csharp
[AgentTool("Some tool", "Unity.ApiSample.SomeTool", assistantMode: AssistantMode.Agent | AssistantMode.Ask)]
public static string SomeTool(ToolExecutionContext context)
{
    if (context.Conversation.PersistentStorage.TryGetState<MyCustomType>("someKey", out var data))
        return data.MyValue;
    
    return "An error occured";
}
```

This is useful for instance when you require some persistent cache for your tools to work properly.
